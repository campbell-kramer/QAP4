For my project I chose to make the drug data file into the .txt file, and the patients data into a postgres database.

The main menu has 5 options the user can access by inputting the corresponding number.
1 - Save Drug to File
2 - Read Drugs from File
3 - Save Patient to Database
4 - Read Patients from Database
5 - Exit

The actual structure of the code and project was relatively easy, as well as the code for accessing/writing the .txt data. 
The hard part was just connecting/disconnecting to the sql server.

Now I will answer the project survey thing.
1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment?
   30
2. What online resources did you use?
   I used class recordings, W3Schools website for general java syntax and stuff, and this youtube channel for some java+postgres help https://www.youtube.com/@cameronmcnz
3. Did you get help from any classmates? 
   No.
4. Did you ask for help from an instructor?
   No.
5. Rate the difficulty of each problem and your confidence in solving similar problems in the future.
   Difficulty was very hard just because I had to problem-solve so much of the connectivity stuff and server details.
